Hi Sam,

Attached is a PDS containing 3 Rexx execs and a $$INDEX member.
These are tools for dealing with PTFs.  $$INDEX contains:

Contents:

ESOGTHLD --  Find and print HOLDDATA for PTFs held for a reason

ESOREALC --  Realloc/copy datasets as required by HOLD(ACTION) PTFs

GETPTF   --  Download/unterse a PTF from IBM's FTP server

Details about using individual execs are in comment blocks in the code.


If you've been following IBM-MAIN recently, you know the history.
